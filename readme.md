Welcome to this Deep-learning optimization repo.

All deep learning optimization algorithms are written from scratch in this repo. Algorithms such as RMSprop, Gradient descent with and without momentum, Adam optimization, and exponential weighted moving average.

Steps to run this code: 
```
1. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

```
2. jupyter notebook
```

Thanks,
